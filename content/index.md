<hintro>I am a PhD Candidate in the [Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning](http://www.pdx.edu/usp) at Portland State. My research focuses on the role, and production, of technology in industrial restructuring. Also urban inequality, labor, GIS and the political economy. This is my site where I keep my research, write about coding and GIS, and keep a blog of epic excerpts from articles I read.</hintro>

### Current Research

I currently split my time among three broad projects.

### Selected Publications

In 2012, I co-authored an article published in the Journal of Planning Literature on the role of open-innovation and crowdsourcing in planning.
