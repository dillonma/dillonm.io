Description: Dillon Mahmoudi, economic geography scholar
*/

<hintro>I am a PhD Candidate in the [Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning](http://www.pdx.edu/usp) at Portland State. My research focuses on: the role, and production, of technology in urban areas; geographies of urban wealth and inequality; and critical quantitative and GIS methods. This is my site where I keep my research, write about coding and GIS, and keep a blog of epic excerpts from things I read.</hintro>

## Current Research
As an economic geographer, my research spans the fields of planning, geography and science, technology and society. I currently split my overarching research interests across three broad projects -- all connected through economic geography, labor and technology.

#### Software and Industrial Restructuring
My dissertation research focuses on the expression of value in capitalist production. More specifically, my research focuses on the various place-specific software production processes among different regions and the relationship between different software industry/firms/workers and broad-based economic development, prosperity and inequality. More broadly, my research focuses on the regional socio-industrial re/configurations under cognitive-cultural capitalism.

As part of the development of this research, I am working with [Greg Schrock](http://www.pdx.edu/profile/meet-assistant-professor-greg-schrock) to update an Economic Development Quarterly paper regarding high-tech and information technologies across the US. I'm also preparing a paper presentation for the 2014 ACSP meeting.

#### Planning & Urban Economic Geographies
On [CityObservatory](http://www.cityobservatory.org) I work with Joe Cortright on a variety of urban-centered questions along both inter-urban and intra-urban levels. We cover topics like economic development policy, geographies of wealth/inequality and social, economic and racial and ethnic diversity and segregation.

In 2013, I co-authored an article published in the Journal of Planning Literature on the role of open-innovation and crowdsourcing in planning. Technologies, the numerous potential development pathways, and nature of adoption in society is core to my research interests.

#### Critical GIS & Urban Agriculture
My research interests in critical GIS has led me to collaborate with [Nathan McClintock](http://urbanfood.org/) to investigate the spatial logics and socioeconomic distribution of urban agriculture in Portland, Oregon. We are currently working on two manuscripts.

Additionally, I attended the _Revisiting Critical GIS_ conference in Friday Harbor, WA where I had the opportunity to connect with a number of other critical GIS scholars. We are currently determining avenues for conference report out, future sessions at upcoming conferences and future written works. Currently two articles are awaiting publication.
