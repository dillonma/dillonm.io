Description: Dillon Mahmoudi, economic geography scholar
*/

<hintro>I am a PhD Candidate in the [Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning](http://www.pdx.edu/usp) at Portland State. I focus my research around three areas: (1) the intersection of cities and digital technologies (production, use, and impacts); (2) the geographies of urban wealth and inequality; and (3) critical quantitative and GIS methods. This is my site where I keep my research, write about coding and GIS, and keep a blog of epic excerpts from things I read.</hintro>

## Current Research
As an economic geographer, my research spans the fields of planning, geography and science, technology and society. I currently split my overarching research interests across three broad projects -- all connected through economic geography, labor and technology. My dissertation research focuses on the expression of value in capitalist production. Specifically, my research focuses on the place-specific software production processes among different regions and the relationship between different software agglomerations (industry/firms/workers) and broad-based economic development, prosperity and inequality. More broadly, my research focuses on the regional socio-industrial re/configurations under cognitive-cultural capitalism. See more under [research](http://dillonm.io/research).
