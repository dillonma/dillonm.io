Description: Dillon Mahmoudi, economic geography scholar
*/

<hintro>I am a PhD Candidate in the [Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning](http://www.pdx.edu/usp) at Portland State. My research focuses on: the role, and production, of technology in urban areas; geographies of urban wealth and inequality; and critical quantitative and GIS methods. This is my site where I keep my research, write about coding and GIS, and keep a blog of epic excerpts from articles I read.</hintro>

## Current Research
As an economic geographer, my research spans the fields of planning, geography and science, technology and society. I currently split my overarching topical research interests of urban economies and technology among three broad projects.

#### HT/IT Industrial Restructuring
Dissertation and research with Greg. The role of software in labor and technology.

#### Urban Economies
Research with Joe.

#### Urban Agriculture
Research with Nathan, GIS.

#### Other Selected Publications
In 2013, I co-authored an article published in the Journal of Planning Literature on the role of open-innovation and crowdsourcing in planning. Technologies, the numerous potential development pathways, and nature of adoption in society is core to my research interests.
