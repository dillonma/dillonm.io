# Wolfgang Haug on the use of the word 'immaterial':

> "In this sense, one might characterise the practice of the ‘immaterialists’, who have fashioned an 
essential element of their symbolic capital out of the talk of ‘immaterial labour’, as itself ‘immaterial’. 
The ‘intellectualisation’ of growing segments of social labour that is driven forward by the development 
of the high-tech mode of production, as well as the breaks and lines of conﬂ icts on this ﬁ eld, are more 
likely being covered up by the imposition of the decisionist category of ‘immaterial labour’ on them."
