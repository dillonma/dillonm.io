## A LITTLE MORE

During high school, I got an opportunity to work on the software side of the Microsoft Keyboards and Mice team in Redmond, WA. After high school, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in Atlanta, GA taking a brief break to work on Microsoft .NET Framework in Dublin, Ireland. I then moved to Austin, TX and worked on the eCommerce Team at National Instruments. In 2009, I moved with my wife to Portland, OR to begin graduate school where I am currently earning my PhD in Urban Studies.

I am a husband, programmer, soccer player, cyclist, beer brewer and thinker. I also eat pizza every Friday. As documentation I post Pizza Friday pictures on <s>Google+</s> Twitter. After all, that which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.

Some of my recent side-projects include creating the Portland Badassness Map and developing the forthcoming interactive Badassness Mapper.

And it’s Mah-moo-dee. Think of “map” when you say “Mah.”
